### What am I doing?
I am using machine learning methods (such as feature importance) to find trends in certain data and the gun violence death rate. 

### How am I doing this?
* Combining multiple datasets

    * Median household income
    * Vast majority income
    * Non-English language
    * Unemployed
    * GDP
    * Real GDP
    * Gun violence death rate
* Applying machine learning methods on this dataset
* Finishing my research paper

## To-Do:
- Finish combining datasets
- Research ML methods to use
- Apply ML methods
- Finish paper
